### 4. Gas Fee Scaling Adjustments (7d9c4ec2 → 86c53d73)
**Date**: Wed Apr 9 02:40:57 2025 → Wed Apr 9 05:40:21 2025
**Files Modified**:
- `src/executor/executor.ts`

**Changes**:
- **First commit (7d9c4ec2)**: Increased gas fee scaling from 150% to 250% per retry iteration
- **Second commit (86c53d73)**: Reverted back to 150% scaling
- Affects `maxFeePerGas`, `maxPriorityFeePerGas`, and `gasPrice` parameters
- This tuning helps with transaction inclusion during network congestion

### 5. IPv4 and IPv6 Support (bbed16b6)

**Files Modified**:
- `src/rpc/server.ts`

- Improves network accessibility and compatibility

### 6. Add Max Block Range (2d9089f6)
**Date**: Tue Jun 3 11:55:05 2025 +0800
**Files Modified**:
- `config.base.json.template`
- `config.baseSepolia.json.template`
- `src/executor/executorManager.ts`

**Changes**:
- Added `max-block-range: 490` configuration to comply with Alchemy's 500 block limit
- Increased `max-bundle-wait` from 1 to 3 seconds for better batching
- Enhanced logging by adding `log-level: debug` configuration
- Fixed TypeScript import issue by switching from `EntryPointV06Abi` to `EntryPointV07Abi`

### 7. Fix Typescript Build (cf160d28)
**Date**: Tue Jun 3 11:58:40 2025 +0800
**Files Modified**:
- `src/executor/executorManager.ts`

**Changes**:
- Cleaned up TypeScript imports to resolve build errors
- Commented out unused `EntryPointV06Abi` import
- Properly organized imports for `EntryPointV07Abi` and `UserOpInfo`

## Impact Summary

These commits collectively enhance the Alto bundler with:

1. **Production Deployment**: Railway-compatible Docker configuration with environment variable management
2. **Cross-Origin Support**: CORS configuration for web application integration
3. **Network Compatibility**: Dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 support
4. **Gas Optimization**: Tuned fee scaling for better transaction inclusion
5. **Provider Compliance**: Block range limits for Alchemy compatibility
6. **Build Stability**: TypeScript import fixes and EntryPoint v0.7 support

## Recommendation for Cursor Patching

When applying these commits to the latest stable version (v1.2.5) of the upstream Alto repository, consider:

1. **Configuration Management**: The Docker and configuration changes are likely safe to apply as they're additive
2. **Gas Fee Logic**: Verify that the 150% scaling logic is still compatible with the latest executor implementation
3. **CORS Configuration**: Ensure the CORS setup doesn't conflict with any security updates in v1.2.5
4. **EntryPoint Version**: Confirm that v1.2.5 uses EntryPoint v0.7 ABI consistently
5. **Network Binding**: Check if the IPv6 configuration is compatible with the latest server implementation

The changes appear to be primarily configuration and deployment-focused, making them good candidates for intelligent patching onto the stable version.


### Additional Commits from Staging Branch (09948cab to c2d43265)

These commits include further improvements and updates:

#### Upgrade TypeScript and Viem Versions (c2d43265 → 8b347f8d)
**Dates**: Sat Jun 14 12:16:06 2025 to Mon Jun 30 17:31:53 2025
**Files Modified**:
- `pnpm-lock.yaml`
- `package.json`
- `src/package.json`
- `test/e2e/package.json`
- New file: `.cursorignore`

**Changes**:
- Upgraded TypeScript from version 5.3.3 to 5.4.0, and eventually to 5.8.3
- Updated `viem` dependency version to 2.24.3 in `test/e2e/package.json`
- Enhanced project setup by including a `.cursorignore` file to exclude unnecessary files and directories
- These upgrades ensure compatibility with newer TypeScript features and improvements, and set the stage for improved development tooling

These additional changes primarily focus on dependency management and toolchain upgrades, designed to improve developer workflow and compatibility.

Recommendations when patching these commits include ensuring compatibility of new TypeScript features with existing code and verifying that the latest `viem` version integrates smoothly with project dependencies.
